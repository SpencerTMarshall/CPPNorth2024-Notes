- Phases of Static Initialization
	- Static Initialization
		- Constant
			- Compile-Time known constant (non-zero) put in .data (or .rodata)
		- Zero
			- Specifically for zeros (nullptr) put into .bss
	- Dynamic Initialization
		- Put into .bss
		- There are Unordered, Partially Ordered, and Ordered members of this group
		- Avoid this
	- Static Local Variables
	- Compiler implementation
		- Dynamic initialization is very complicated
			- Compilers will create a function to check the value of the variable during the runtime to check if it has been initialized.
	- Common Patterns
		- Meyers' Singleton
		- Nifty Counter
	- You can use a lot of these ways (except dynamic initialization) to ensure safe initialization for libraries
