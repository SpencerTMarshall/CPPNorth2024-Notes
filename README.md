# CPPNorth2024-Notes

This past month I had the opportunity to attend CPPNorth 2024 over the span of 3 days. It was an incredible experience and I learned a huge amount about programming in C++.

This repo contains edited versions of the notes I took during the conference (with some talks I attended excluded due to a lack of quality notes.) The notes are divided into the 3 days of the conference and the actual video recordings of the talks should be findable at [CppNorth's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cppnorth).

The speakers of each talk are credited in the first line of each note's page, and I would recommend if you want to learn the topics of the different talks to watch the youtube videos on the CppNorth channel directly.
